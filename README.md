## STAR SWAPI

SWapi-box is the first project assigned in mod three at Turing School in Denver, CO. My iteration of the solo project has been dubbed STAR SWAPI. The project is intended to solidify the understanding and use of fetch calls and nested fetch calls using the Star Wars api at https://swapi.co/.

### Intall/Setup

- `clone the repo`
- `run npm install`
- `run npm start`
- direct your browswer to localhost:3000

Instructions: enjoy the scrolling text of a randomly selected Star Wars movie or select one of the buttons from the top of the screen to view additional information displayed on cards below the buttons.

## Stack
- Jest/Enzyme
- React
- SCSS

##Learning goals
This project left a bittersweet taste in my mouth. I accomplished the main learning goal of better understanding fetch calls, the promises they return and how to work with loading screens and potential delays when working with multiple api calls. As an ancillary benefit, this project helped me better understand React â€” specifically writing and using functional components as well as using destructuring to make prop drilling more readable and my first ever switch statement. 

All that to say, my personal goal was to walk away with a solid grasp of testing and that did not happen. I do have a better understanding of the syntax and the tools available to test, but implementing those tools still leads to a great deal of errors and frustration. I have spent a great deal of time on testing without progress and need to consider other avenues to increase my understanding. This project was a step forward, but not the finish I was hoping for.
